#### Announcements
{% comment %} Removed after first week
- Please read the [FAQ](http://cs107e.stanford.edu) for answers to common questions about the course. We expect to have more interested students than capacity. To be considered, you must attend the first lecture and submit the interest questionnaire.
-Our class discussion form is hosted on [Piazza]({{ site.data.quarter.forum }}). We will post all announcements on Piazza and you can ask and answer questions there.   
{% endcomment %}
- __May 4, 2020__: It's time to start thinking about [final projects](http://cs107e.github.io/assignments/project/)! We're getting this started early to make sure you have enough time to get any hardware you might need, given all of the shipping delays. Your first milestone is this Saturday, in which you submit your project idea and group. Please read [the handout](http://cs107e.github.io/assignments/project/) for more information.
- __April 19, 2020__: Remember that this week's lab needs some extra supplies: solid core wire (24 AWG or thinner), wire snips, pliers, and a wire stripper. If you don't have them yet please get them before lab.
- __April 5, 2020__: We're looking forward to seeing you all in class tomorrow!
