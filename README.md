# CS 107E
This repo contains the codebase for the CS107E course (including the course website, 
the labs, and the assignment starter code. This is a capture of the material from
around January 2020, when the course was still using the Raspbery Pi 3A+.

## Notes/Todo
This repo contains everything except the homebrew packages at that time. Those are still
available on GH, but I still need to pull them in to preserve them.
